BRF Cakes, cakes, and PF Cakes are all different names for the same thing. They are made of `brown rice flour(BRF), vermiculite, and water`. Once these cakes are made and sterilized, you add spores, the spores germinate, and mycelium starts growing. Once the mycelium is finished growing and consolidating, these cakes are birthed, dunk and rolled, and placed in a SGFC for fruiting.

SGFC stands for Shotgun Fruiting Chamber and is called this because of its appearance; it has a bunch of holes in it. There is really only one correct way to make a SGFC, and I've described it in Basic Principles of the Shotgun Fruiting Chamber (SGFC).

This method is considered to be the best for noobs because it requires a small initial financial investment and doesn't require a pressure cooker.
