## Difficulty
`Beginner`

## Materials

* Whole Oats
* Whole Millet/Bird Seed
* Quart or Pint Jars
* Water
* Food grade scale
* Pressure Cooker
* *Optional* - `Clean funnel`

# How to?
### Oats - Quart Jars
1.) 235grams of oats  

2.) 165grams of water

### Millet/Birdseed - Quart Jars
1.) 250grams of millet/birdseed

2.) 160grams of water

### Oats & Millet - Quart Jars
1.) 130grams of oats

2.) 130grams of millet/birdseed

3.) 170grams-180g of water



1. Choose what method you are going to use
2. Per method, weigh out the amount of substrate
3. Per method, weigh out the amount of water
4. Put the lid on the jar if you dont have a hole with papertape in the lid, put the metal lid on upside down and *tighten*
5. Place all of the jars you made up into a Pressure Cooker
6. Add water to PC after all the jars are in, I usually go 1/2 the way up the jars that are standing in the bottom of PC. (You will be PCing for 2 hours, so dont want to run them dry)
8. PC for 2 Hours at 15psi. *Very Important* - When the PCs get down to 0psi, and you can take the top off, use oven mitts and shake vigorously. This will disperse the humidity 
9. Let cool down, and then infront of a PC, or SAB, knock your jars up with `agar` or `spore syringe`! 

## Tips 

I use modded lids with a 3/16” hole and a filter disc stickers. I don’t like un-modded because of the hot shake. There’s gas exchange going on and I’d rather not have that happening unfiltered. You do you though. This is my way honed over many years, many jars, and losses that were lessons.

I run my jars STRAIGHT UP in the PC, no foil (because I have SFD stickers) for two hours. I let the pressure drop naturally, and once it’s equalized, I pull out the jars for the hot shake. Make sure to break up the wet mass at the bottom and mix it up really well. You can shake it up again after it cools. Not necessary to do it lots more, but if you want, go for it. 

If you find you have a lot of burst grains, don’t fret, just reduce your water amount 5-10g on the next run. Every batch of grain is different, so it’s smart to pay attention to how that first batch goes. Only adjust by 5-10g up or down.
