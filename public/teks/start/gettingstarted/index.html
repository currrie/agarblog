<h1 id="mushroom-cultivation">Mushroom Cultivation</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Mushroom cultivation requires 2 basic things: You need to grow mycelium on a substrate, then get that mycelium to produce mushrooms. Getting the mycelium to produce mushrooms is referred to as <em>fruiting</em> because mushrooms are the fruit bodies of mycelium.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-two-most-popular-ways-to-grow-the-species-psilocybe-cubensis-mushrooms-are-using-one-of-these">The two most popular ways to grow the species <code>(psilocybe cubensis)</code> mushrooms are using one of these</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monotub using bulk substrate</strong> or</li>
<li><strong>Shot Gun Fruiting Chamber</strong> (SGFC) using <code>PF/BRF Cakes</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Both <strong>SGFC</strong> and <strong>monotubs</strong> are types of fruiting chambers. A <strong>fruiting chamber</strong> is what you are going to grow your <strong>mushrooms</strong> in.</p>
<p><code>PF/BRF</code> Cakes and bulk substrate are the actual material you grow mycelium and fruit mushrooms on. Bulk substrates go in a monotub and cakes go in a <strong>SGFC</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="teks-whats-that-mean">&ldquo;Teks? Whats that mean?'&rdquo;</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Tek: T.E.K. stands for <code>Traditional Ecological Knowledge</code> Sort of like a technique. Often prefaced with something to tell you what type of Tek; e.g. PF-Tek, one of the original home growing techniques on which many others are based.</p>

<h1 id="spore-print--spore-syringes">Spore Print &amp; Spore Syringes</h1>
<h2 id="spore-print"><code>Spore Print</code>:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A &ldquo;print&rdquo; is a collection of spores a mushroom drops once it has reached full maturity. A spore print is a piece of clean paper (or wax paper, card stock, index card, tinfoil, or photo paper, glass slide&hellip;.) that has this collection of spores on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A spore print can be used in several ways, and has certain advantages. First, as mentioned before, spore prints can be used to create spore syringes. Further, they are the easiest method by which spores may be shipped - a spore print can easily be contained in a letter. Spore prints are also a better way of storing prints for a longer period of time, as compared to spore syringes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A spore print does have its disadvantages compared to a spore syringe. First, &ldquo;dry&rdquo; spores should not be used to inoculate substrates with, and spores stored in print form are - by their very nature - dry. Spores should be hydrated to work effectively and inoculate as many points in the substrate as possible. The &ldquo;fresher&rdquo; a print is (how old it is from time of printing), the less time required to effectively rehydrate spores.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="spore-syringe"><code>Spore Syringe</code>:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A <code>spore syringe</code> is a mixture of sterile water and mushroom spores, contained in a syringe. Oftentimes, a spore print will be used to provide the spores which spore syringes are made of.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A <code>Spore syringe</code> is generally used for one purpose only - to inoculate sterile substrates with spores.</p>
