# Where do I begin?

>So you've chosen to start growing **mushrooms**. So, what's next? So, where do you begin? You attempted to use the search function, but there is so much information. You have no idea what questions to ask, let alone what strategy to use. There's a lot of contradicting information out there.

# The Breakdown

Mushroom cultivation requires 2 basic things: You need to grow mycelium on a substrate, then get that mycelium to produce mushrooms. Getting the mycelium to produce mushrooms is referred to as *fruiting* because mushrooms are the fruit bodies of mycelium.
>The two most popular ways to grow the species `(psilocybe cubensis)` mushrooms are using one of these 
* **Monotub using bulk substrate** or 
* **Shot Gun Fruiting Chamber** (SGFC) using `PF/BRF Cakes`

> Both **SGFC** and **monotubs** are types of fruiting chambers. A **fruiting chamber** is what you are going to grow your **mushrooms** in.

`PF/BRF` Cakes and bulk substrate are the actual material you grow mycelium and fruit mushrooms on. Bulk substrates go in a monotub and cakes go in a **SGFC**.

## "Teks? Whats that mean?'"
Tek: T.E.K. stands for `Traditional Ecological Knowledge` Sort of like a technique. Often prefaced with something to tell you what type of Tek; e.g. PF-Tek, one of the original home growing techniques on which many others are based.
